      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">If you have the information required to use GOV.UK One Login</h3>

      <p class="govuk-body">You can <a href="/release1-dev-v4/one-login/one-login-start" class="govuk-link">try proving your identity with GOV.UK One Login again</a>.</p> 

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">If you do not have the information required to use GOV.UK One Login</h3>

      <p class="govuk-body">You can ask an <a href="../pre-one-login/acsp-route" class="govuk-link">Authorised Corporate Service Provider (ACSP)</a>, such as an accountant or solicitor, to verify your identity on your behalf. This is also known as a Companies House authorised agent. You can do this from any country, 
     but your agent must register with Companies House in order to become authorised. They must be registered with a UK Anti-Money Laundering (AML) supervisory body. You’ll need to provide suitable identity documents.</p> 

   

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What happens if you do not verify </h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">
        There will be a transition period for existing directors and people with significant control (PSCs), so that you have time to do what the regulations require. <a href="../pre-one-login/guidance-when" class="govuk-link">
