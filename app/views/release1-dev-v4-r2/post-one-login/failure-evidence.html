      <h1 class="govuk-heading-l">Ways you can prove your identity for Companies House </h1>

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">If you have the information required to use GOV.UK One Login</h3>

      <p class="govuk-body">You can <a href="/release1-dev-v4/one-login/one-login-start" class="govuk-link">try proving your identity with GOV.UK One Login again</a>.</p> 

      <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">If you do not have the information required to use GOV.UK One Login</h3>

      <p class="govuk-body">You can ask an <a href="../post-one-login/acsp-route" class="govuk-link">Authorised Corporate Service Provider (ACSP)</a>, such as an accountant or solicitor, to verify your identity on your behalf. This is also known as a Companies House authorised agent. You can do this from any country, 
     but your agent must register with Companies House in order to become authorised. They must be registered with a UK Anti-Money Laundering (AML) supervisory body. You’ll need to provide suitable identity documents.</p> 

   

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What happens if you do not verify </h2>

      }) }}

 <p class="govuk-body">In the future, we'll publish a note against your name on the Companies House public register. You will also be unable to:</p>

        <li>be appointed as a new director to an existing company</li>
        <li>register a new company or entity</li>

      </ul>

       <p class="govuk-body">We will use the full range of our powers to make sure everyone complies with the verification requirements, and take action against anyone who does not comply. <!--To find out more, <a href="#" class="govuk-link">

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">Directors (or equivalent)</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">
  Each director will get a personal code when they verify. You’ll need to provide these codes when you file the confirmation statement. Your company will be unable to file its confirmation statement unless all its directors are verified.
</p>

<p class="govuk-body">
  If you continue to act as a director after the deadline without complying with all verification requirements, you will be committing an offence. The company (or entity) and all directors may also be committing an offence.
</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">People with significant control (PSCs)</h3>

<p class="govuk-body">
 If you continue to be a PSC after the deadline without complying with all verification requirements, you may be committing an offence.
