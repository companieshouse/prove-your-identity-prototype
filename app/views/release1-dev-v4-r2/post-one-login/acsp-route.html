        Verifying with an Authorised Corporate Service Provider (ACSP) 
      </h1>
  
      <p class="govuk-body">An ACSP can verify your identity for Companies House on your behalf. For example, an accountant or solicitor. This is also known as a Companies House authorised agent. 
      </p>
  
      <p class="govuk-body">You can do this from any country, but your agent must register with Companies House in order to become authorised. They must be registered with a UK Anti-Money Laundering (AML) supervisory body. </p>
  
    
      <p class="govuk-body">If you use an agent, your identity will only be verified for Companies House, not any other government service or department.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What happens next</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">When an agent has agreed to verify your identity, you will need to provide documents from an approved list as evidence of your identity. They may charge a fee for their services.</p>
