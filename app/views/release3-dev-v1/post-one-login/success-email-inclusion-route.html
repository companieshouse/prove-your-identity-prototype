<h1 class="govuk-heading-l">Identity verified: next steps to complete verification requirements</h1>

<p class="govuk-body">You’ve successfully verified your identity for Companies House. This email contains your Companies House personal code, and important information about what you need to do next to complete all identity verification requirements.</p>

<div class="highlight-box"> 
      <p class="govuk-body">Companies House personal code: <strong>XXX-9999-9999</strong></p>

      <p class="govuk-body">Keep your code safe. You can share it with people if they file on your behalf. For example, if you use an agent like an accountant or company secretary provider.</p>
  </div>

  <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Next steps to complete verification requirements</h2>

   <p class="govuk-body">What you need to do next depends on your role, and when you started that role.</p>

   <p class="govuk-body">If you’re a director or PSC (or both), you’ll need to use your Companies House personal code to connect your verified identity to our records for each role you hold. This is part of the legal requirement to verify your identity for Companies House.</p>

    <p class="govuk-body">For more information, read the ‘How to use your personal code’ section of the personal code guidance:</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Save your personal code</h2>

        <p class="govuk-body">We recommend that you save your personal code to a Companies House account. This only takes a couple of minutes and means you’ll be able to access it when you need to.</p>

      <div class="govuk-inset-text">
  <p class="govuk-body">To do this, you’ll need to:</p>
<ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>sign in or create sign in details using <strong>email@example.com</strong></li>
  <li>enter your Companies House personal code</li>
  <li>enter your date of birth</li>
</ul>
