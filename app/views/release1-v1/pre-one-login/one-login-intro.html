      We’re taking you to verify your identity with GOV.UK 
    </h1>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">
      With the GOV.UK app  
    </h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">If you verify online, you can download an 
      app to scan your biometric ID. It’s the fastest and easiest 
      way to verify. You can use any up-to-date mobile phone to get
       the app, it doesn’t need to be your own.</p>

    <h3 class="govuk-heading-s">
      Without the GOV.UK app  
    </h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">You can continue without using the app. You 
      will be asked some questions about your financial history to 
      verify your identity. </p>

    <p class="govuk-body">When you have verified your identity successfully, 
      we'll take you back to Companies House to continue.</p>
