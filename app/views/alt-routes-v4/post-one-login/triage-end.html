<p class="govuk-body">We’ll email you at <strong>example@email.com</strong> with information about how to verify your identity.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">When we’ll email you</h3>

    <p class="govuk-body">You’ve told us your confirmation statement due date is {{ confirmationDate.day }} {{ confirmationDate.monthName }} {{ confirmationDate.year }}. If this date has not passed yet, we’ll aim to email you by then with information about how to verify your identity. </p>

 <p class="govuk-body">If this date has already passed, we’ll email you as soon as we are able to.</p>

  <p class="govuk-body">You should check your inbox regularly, including your spam folder. We cannot guarantee we'll be able to contact you by the date of your next confirmation statement.</p>

<h3 class="govuk-heading-s">What information the email will include</h3>

 <p class="govuk-body">The email will let you know what identity documents and information you need to provide, and how to provide them. You'll be able to use a passport if you have one. If you do not already have a passport, and you are able to get one, you may wish to start the passport application process now.</p>

     It could be a while before we email you. As this is a new service, we don’t know how long this will take. Print or save this page so that you can refer back to this information.

<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What happens if you successfully verify your identity</h2>
  
       <p class="govuk-body">You’ll get a unique identifier known as a Companies House personal code. The code is personal to you, not your company or a company you work for. You'll need the code to comply with identity verification requirements.</p>

      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">You can still verify using an Authorised Corporate Service Provider (ACSP)</h2>

      <p class="govuk-body">If you do not want to wait to verify by providing evidence to Companies House, you can
   <a href="https://prove-your-identity-prototype.herokuapp.com/alt-routes-v1/post-one-login/acsp-route" class="govuk-link">use an ACSP instead</a>. This is also known as a Companies House authorised agent. </p>

   <p class="govuk-body">It can be quicker to verify your identity using an ACSP.</p>

This will give you more time to provide your personal code and verification statement to us.</p>-->
