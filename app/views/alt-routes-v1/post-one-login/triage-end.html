       We'll aim to email you at <strong>example@email.com</strong> before your next confirmation statement date, with information about how to verify your identity. However, if your confirmation statement is due soon, we cannot guarantee we'll be able to contact you by its due date. You should check your inbox regularly, including your junk folder.
