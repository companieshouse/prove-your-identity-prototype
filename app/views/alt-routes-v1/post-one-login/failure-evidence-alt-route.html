        You'll soon be able to ask a <a href="/alt-routes-v1/post-one-login/acsp-route" class="govuk-link">Companies House authorised agent</a>
        (such as an accountant or solicitor) to verify your identity on your behalf. This is also known as an Authorised Corporate Service Provider (ACSP). You can do this from any country, 
        but your agent must register with Companies House in order to become authorised. They must be registered with a UK Anti-Money Laundering (AML) supervisory body. You’ll need to provide suitable identity documents.
