        How to verify using an Authorised Corporate Service Provider (ACSP) 
      </h1>
  
  <p class="govuk-body">You will need to find an ACSP to verify your identity. This is also known as a Companies House authorised agent. </p>
  
      <p class="govuk-body">You can do this from any country, but your agent must register with Companies House in order to become authorised.</p>

        <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">Who can be an ACSP</h2>

           <p class="govuk-body">An ACSP is a person or organisation that is registered with a UK Anti-Money Laundering (AML) supervisory body. For example:
            <ul class="govuk-list govuk-list--bullet">
  <li>company formation agents</li>
  <li>accountants</li>
  <li>solicitors</li>
</ul>
      </p>


      <h2 class="govuk-heading-m">How to find an ACSP</h2>

         <p class="govuk-body">If you have an existing accountant or solicitor (or any other AML-supervised professional), you can ask them if they are registered with Companies House as an ACSP. If not, you'll need to find one. For example, by doing an online search.
      </p>
  
<h2 class="govuk-heading-m">What happens next</h2>

   <p class="govuk-body">When an ACSP has agreed to verify your identity, you will need to provide documents from an approved list as evidence of your identity. They may charge a fee for their services.
      </p>
