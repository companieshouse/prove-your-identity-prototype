  <li>passport</li>
  <li>driving licence</li>

      <p class="govuk-body">If you do not want to wait to verify by providing evidence to Companies House, you can
   <a href="https://prove-your-identity-prototype.herokuapp.com/alt-routes-v1/post-one-login/acsp-route" class="govuk-link">use an ACSP instead</a>. These are also known as Companies House authorised agents. </p>
